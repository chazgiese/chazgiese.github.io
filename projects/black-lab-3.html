    <h3>Problems</h3>
    <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
      <li>Visual design doesn't feel individual to a stations brand</li>
      <li>Radio stations have total control of navigation items, often leading to undesired user behavior journeys</li>
      <li>The most sought-after information isn't immediately available</li>
      <li>The UI is outdated</li>
      <li>Site customizations are too granular in certain areas and nonexistent where necessary</li>
      <li>Certain corporate business goals are not being met</li>
      <li>Mobile experience frustrating and leads to high bounce rates</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
      <li>Create a flexible design system that can adjust to create a native brand feel</li>
      <li>Locked down navigation items that have clear meaning and lead to desired user journeys</li>
      <li>Present most sought-after information above the fold</li>
      <li>Modernize the UI</li>
      <li>Define a goldilocks balance of station customizations to ensure quality user experience and aesthetic integrity</li>
      <li>A mobile-first experience</li>
      <li>Assimilated changes to achieve corporate business goals</li>

    <h2>Design System</h2>
    <p>I created a design system to unsure consistency and speed up the design and development. As the design process progressed the design system became more flushed out. When new views/screens were needed to be mocked up the process was able to be done quickly and maintain consistency across the product. Engineers were able to reference this guide which sped up their development process as well.</p>

    <h4>Color Palettes</h4>
    <p>With 200+ radio stations also comes 200+ brands. To insure a good user experience, both in legibility and aesthetically, it was important to provide a focused set of color palettes that would play nice with a wide range of brands.</p>

    <h2>Navigation</h2>
    <p>Pre-Black Lab 3, station producers were able to program any items they desired into the navigation. This often lead to nav items like "Bob and Friends Amazing Morning Show"... not an ideal. Early in the design process it was clear the navigation items would need to be locked to specific items. To address user and business goals alike, the nav items were simplified to "Watch", "Listen", "Win".</p>

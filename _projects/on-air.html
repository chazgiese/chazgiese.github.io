  <h3>The Radio Experience</h3>
  <p>On the first launch of the app local stations are browsable, creating a metaphor similar to the traditional radio experience. If a user is listening to a hip-hop station and wants to skip the song it switches to another one of Alpha Media's hip-hop stations, regardless of location. This creates live and human DJ'd experience, all while keeping users within Alpha Media's content.</p>

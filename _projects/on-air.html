    <h3>Problems</h3>
    <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
      <li>Station content is siloed and distributed across many sites</li>
      <li>Only way for users to keep up with their stations in one place is social networks outside the control of Alpha Media</li>
      <li>Discovery of new content is difficult and time consuming</li>
      <li>When listening on the station website and something comes on the user doesn't want to listen to they leave</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
      <li>Bring the experience of station flipping to mobile</li>

      <li>Keep up with the latest from all your favorite stations in one place</li>
      <li>Engage with stations in new ways</li>

    <h3>The Radio Experience</h3>
    <p>On the first launch of the app local stations are browsable, creating a metaphor similar to the traditional radio experience. If a user is listening to a hip-hop station and wants to skip the song it switches to another one of Alpha Media's hip-hop stations, regardless of location. This creates live and human DJ'd experience, all while keeping users within Alpha Media's content.</p>

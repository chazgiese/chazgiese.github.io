  <h3>Design System</h3>
  <p>I created a design system to unsure consistency and speed up the design and development. As the design process progressed the design system became more flushed out. When new views/screens were needed to be mocked up the process was able to be done quickly and maintain consistency across the product. Engineers were able to reference this guide which sped up their development process as well.</p>

  <h4>Color Palettes</h4>
  <p>With 200+ radio stations also comes 200+ brands. To insure a good user experience, both in legibility and aesthetically, it was important to provide a focused set of color palettes that would play nice with a wide range of brands.</p>

  <h3>Navigation</h3>
  <p>Pre-Black Lab 3, station producers were able to program any items they desired into the navigation. This often lead to nav items like "Bob and Friends Amazing Morning Show"... not an ideal. Early in the design process it was clear the navigation items would need to be locked to specific items. To address user and business goals alike, the nav items were simplified to "Watch", "Listen", "Win".</p>

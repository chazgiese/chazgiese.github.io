# Chaz Giese's Personal Website
A simple static website. If you'd like a similar static site setup I recommend using the same [boilerplate](https://github.com/erickzhao/static-html-webpack-boilerplate) I used!

## Stack
- HTML
- SCSS
- ES6
- Webpack
- Node

## THANK YOU
- Erick Zhao for creating an awesome [boilerplate](https://github.com/erickzhao/static-html-webpack-boilerplate)
